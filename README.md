<p>There comes a time in any CS student's life, when they realize that they have been spending hours every month trying to remember scripts they wrote (and inevitably forgot about) the month before.</p>
<p>At that moment, after recovering from the shocking epiphany, such students often make the final extra step, and make a git repository to store such miscellanea.</p>
<p>This is one such repository.</p>
<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>The code in this repository has been written in moments of anger, frustration, and, more often than not, sleep deprivation. They are meant to solve very specific (i.e. <em>my</em>) problems, with no pretensions of efficiency.</p>
